I help people to explore their emotions through phone counseling and in person, and support them through their counseling journey. I hope I can help you today, and give you some more information to make those first steps.</p><p>Perhaps you are finding life really difficult at the moment in the current climate and the pandemic has brought new challenges?

I found a new way to process emotions, manage past trauma and realized life didn’t have to feel quite so hard every day. I became passionate about helping people with their personal challenges and the power of talking therapies.</p><p>So often in life we try to do everything by ourselves, we feel we must ‘stay strong’, or ‘take a positive approach’, that we can’t burden others with our problems…and of course the list goes on. All these limitations and pressures we put upon ourselves only serve to make us feel more isolated and powerless. Even when we are at our rock bottom, we can still be so ashamed and worried of asking for help, and when we do, we don’t always get the responses we really need or deserve.</p><p>Counseling gave me the safe space to take those first steps to heal and find a new way of living. I hope it can for you too.</p><p>When we speak I want to create an environment in which you feel you are in a safe space to be listened to, understood and accepted for exactly the person you are.</p></div></div><div class="row scroll-reveal mx-0"><div class="mb-3 bg-opaque shadow-sm w-100 rounded"><div class="row no-gutters"><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8 d-flex align-items-center"><div class="card-text p-4 p-md-5 font-weight-light"><blockquote class="font-italic">"People only seriously consider change when they feel accepted for exactly who they are." <cite>- Carl Rogers</cite></blockquote></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4"><img src="images/autumn_leaves.jpg" class="card-img" alt="hand holdingautumn leaves"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid" id="my_experience"><div class="container py-8"><div class="row scroll-reveal"><div class="col-12"><h2>My training and approach</h2></div></div><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12"><p>I trained at the Life-force School of Counselling in Colchester and gained a BACP gold accredited Integrative diploma.</p><p>I also have a fine Art degree and am very encouraging of clients who like to work creatively or express their emotions through creative work.</p><p>I regularly undertake continuing professional development as required by the BACP with a special interest in child hood trauma, Complex PTSD, Addiction and narcissistic abuse.</p><p>Integrative counselling combines person centered, CBT and psychodynamic approaches. What that means is that I essentially work from a ‘tool box’ of different approaches which I tailor to your needs and personality. If you would like any extra information about Integrative counseling I would be happy to send you some via email.</p><p>Most importantly and ‘jargon’ aside we will work together with what you bring to the session. You won’t be given advice, lectured or told what to do, nor will you be quizzed whilst I sit in front of you with a clipboard. I will ask questions, listen, empathize and I may gently try to explore something you have brought up, but ultimately I respect and take my lead from you</p><p>Clients are often surprised when they find counseling is a lot more relaxed than they first thought. In our first session you will decide at the end if you want to work with me. I will be gentle, kind and thoughtful in my approach, and really try to understand what it feels like to be you. I remember what the first counseling session is like and how nerve wracking it can be, therefore I will do my absolute best to help you feel relaxed and comfortable.</p></div></div><div class="row mb-6 scroll-reveal"><div class="col-12"><h3>Experience</h3><p>I currently work on the team at Life-force centre for counseling in which I counsel adults only.
