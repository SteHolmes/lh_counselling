Do you try so hard to stay positive, juggle everything and make sure the world around you thinks you’re coping ok. Is the reality actually, that you are trying so hard to fight back the tears each day. But in fact, you feel alone and don’t want to burden anyone.</p><p>Do you see the same unhealthy relationship patterns unravel year upon year? Maybe you are trapped in addiction, self harm or self destructive behavior. Do you look for any way to escape those painful feelings? Are you reactive and angry with your partner but baffled as to how the conflict starts?</p><p>Do you feel anxious, panicked, sad, exhausted, lonely and unable to concentrate at work?</p><p>Would you like a safe space to explore these feelings? To look at how you’re past may be affecting your present? Are you just sick and tired of feeling so unhappy and long for a different journey? I would like to help you with this.</p><p>I listen, empathize and gently try to understand what it feels like to be you. I will help you to explore your issues but never push you to talk about things that you are not ready for. I can’t promise to fix you or instantly take away your pain, but I will help you to put the pieces of your jigsaw together and begin the path to healing and happiness. I am a warm, relatable person and my style of therapy is collaborative so I won’t just sit in silence. I will gently challenge and help you to explore your thoughts and feelings in a non judgmental safe way.</p><p>If you think you would like therapy with me, then please send a <a href="#contact">text, email or give me a call</a>. I understand committing to therapy takes courage, so I offer a free 15 min phone consultation in which you can give me a brief outline of why you would like counselling and ask any questions that you might have.</p></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mx-0"><div class="mb-3 shadow-sm w-100 border rounded"><div class="row no-gutters"><div class="col-md-6"><img src="images/lighthouse.jfif" class="card-img" alt="beach walkway to a lighthouse"></div><div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center"><div class="p-4 p-md-5"><p class="card-text font-weight-light">Would you like to get some clarity on why you feel the way you do, understand yourself better and begin a path to healing and happiness?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid bg-secondary" id="about"><div class="container py-5 py-md-8"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="text-white">About me</h2></div></div><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12"><p>I am a fully qualified integrative counsellor based in Colchester and registered with the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy which means I abide by their code of ethics. I have monthly clinical supervision with an experienced accredited supervisor. I also hold full insurance, an up to date DBS certificate and am registered with the ICO.</p><p>Through my own personal challenges and struggles I embarked on a counselling journey which became life changing. I found a new way to process emotions, manage past trauma and realized life didn’t have to feel quite so hard every day. I became passionate about helping people with their personal challenges and the power of talking therapies.</p><p>So often in life we try to do everything by ourselves, we feel we must be strong or take a positive approach, that we can’t burden others with our problems. All these limitations and pressures we put upon ourselves only serve to make us feel more isolated and powerless. Even when we are at our rock bottom, we can still feel so ashamed and worried of asking for help, and when we do, we don’t always get the response we really need or deserve.</p><p>Counselling gave me the safe space to take those first steps to heal and find a new way of living. I hope it can for you too.</p><p>When we speak I hope to create an environment in which you feel you are in a safe space to be listened to, understood and accepted for exactly the person you are.</p></div></div><div class="row mx-0"><div class="mb-3 bg-opaque shadow-sm w-100 rounded"><div class="row no-gutters"><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8 d-flex align-items-center"><div class="card-text p-4 p-md-5 font-weight-light"><blockquote class="font-italic">"People only seriously consider change when they feel accepted for exactly who they are." <cite>- Carl Rogers</cite></blockquote></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4"><img src="images/autumn_leaves.jpg" class="card-img" alt="hand holding autumn leaves"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div class="container py-5 py-md-8"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><h2>My training and approach</h2></div></div><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12"><p>I have a BACP accredited diploma in Integrative counselling.</p><p>I also have a fine Art degree and am very encouraging of clients who like to work creatively or express their emotions through creative work.</p><p>I regularly undertake continuing professional development as required by the BACP with a special interest in Child hood trauma, Complex PTSD, Addiction and Narcissistic abuse.</p><p>As an integrative counsellor I essentially work from a ‘tool box’ of different therapy approaches which I tailor to your needs and personality. These include psychodynamic theory, transactional analysis, person centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, Gestalt, and some creative work. If you would like any extra information about Integrative counselling I would be happy to send you some via email.</p><p>Clients are often surprised when they find counselling is a lot more relaxed than they first thought. In our first session you will decide at the end if you want to work with me. I will be gentle, kind and thoughtful in my approach, and really try to understand what it feels like to be you. I remember what the first counselling session is like and how nerve wracking it can be, therefore I will do my absolute best to help you feel relaxed and comfortable.</p></div></div><div class="row mb-4 mb-md-6"><div class="col-12"><h3>Experience</h3><p>I currently work on the team at <a href="https://www.lifeforce-centre.co.uk/" target="_blank">Life-Force</a> centre for counselling in which I counsel adults only.
